Network Intrusion Detection Model based on Deep Learning Techniques

Abstract—Several network attacks increase yearly, and standard firewalls and data encryption solutions cannot constantly
meet the needs of existing network safety measures. As a result,
network intrusion detection technologies have been created.
Detecting and managing these dangers with typical analytic
methods is extremely difficult. Although it has lower detection rates and requires extensive feature engineering, machine
learning is used to augment conventional intrusion detection
algorithms. This research proposes a Deep Learning Model for
network intrusion detection to solve the issue of low detection
accuracy. The suggested IDS blends data analytics, statistical
techniques, and recent advancements in Machine learning theory
to get optimal and further associated qualities. A benchmarking
database known as NSL-KDD is used to verify the validity of the
proposed IDS. When evaluating to remaining machine learning
classifiers, the proposed Intrusion Detection System gets the most
remarkable accuracy of 97.7% when employing the LSTM and
MLP classifiers.

VI. CONCLUSION
We introduced a new statistical analysis and deep learningdependent IDS technique in this analysis. As a reference, the
suggested Model is examined using the NSL-KDD dataset.
The conventional measurement system was used to assess the
proposed IDS’ capabilities and efficacy. Statistical analysis
was used to extract the most correlated features, which would
then be fed into deep (Autoencoder, LSTM) and deep ML
techniques. Furthermore, both binary and multi-classification
were carried out. When equated to existing machine learning
classifiers, the proposed Intrusion Detection System gets the
most remarkable accuracy of 97.7% when employing the
LSTM and MLP classifiers. We will employ deep learning
classifiers in the future to detect intrusions on additional
datasets that are available online, as well as real-time data.
